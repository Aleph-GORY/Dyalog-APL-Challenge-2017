# Healthcare Problem Set - Extra material

In this folder you will find two main files
  1.- APL Healthcare.exe
  2.- APL Healthcare.pdf      Probaliy, this file will be updated a little after the first one.
 
The first one, is a spreadsheet that contains an Empirical model of the 4 Tasks in this problem set. I personally used in the problem to 
verify my answers. You are free to check and modify the values in this document in order to a better understanding of my solution and
why it works.

The second one, is a document in which all the procedures and logic implemented in the solution are explained and writed in a organized
way.
